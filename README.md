## Introduction

This repo contains the TASE algorithm and scripts for processing data used for publication.
This is the most advanced version of TASE for acoustic analyses, and we will keep this repository up-to-date and provide improved interfaces to enable scientists with no CS background to run the analysis.

Feel free to use TASE for your acoustic analyses and research. Please cite as:

## Abstract 
Accurate biodiversity assessment is fundamental for effective conservation management and environmental policy-making.
However, monitoring local species populations is time-consuming, as experts can cover only one limited area at a time and are also prone to errors due to their varying knowledge and experience. 
Advances in low-cost autonomous recording units and AI-based classifiers offer new tools for species monitoring.
However, while helpful in identifying species, current tools for acoustic species monitoring fall short in providing data on local populations. 
This limitation emphasizes the demand for more sophisticated methods, as uncertainties in estimating species populations can lead to misleading conclusions and misclassification of conservation statuses. 
In this work, we take a significant step towards more sophisticated monitoring by presenting a Territorial Acoustic Species Estimation approach, called TASE, to extract spatial, territorial patterns of species using acoustic sensor networks, allowing the estimation of territorial individuals of a species. 
It requires a distributed sensor network and exploits the characteristic spatial distribution of territorial species. 
We formalize TASE, apply it to bird acoustics, and share a proof-of-concept evaluation in a real-world deployment in a nature reserve, deploying 29 devices over 12 hectares. 
We show that it works on par with the time-consuming practice applied by bird experts and can provide novel insights into the spatial use of sound-producing territorial species.

## Minimal Working Example

This minimal working example demonstrates how to apply Territorial Acoustic Species Estimation (TASE) using a subset of data from a real-world deployment. 
The script processes acoustic sensor network data to estimate bird territories based on Sylvia atricapilla recordings.

1. **Define Species of Interest**: The script initializes the Sylvia atricapilla species from the core species definitions.

```
   spec = Sylvia_atricapilla()
```

2. **Parse Node Locations**: The function reads node locations from a CSV file and converts them into UTM coordinates.
```
    node_locations = parse_audiomoth_locations(csv_node_locations)
   location_data_list = convert_wgs84_to_utm(node_locations, zone_number=32, zone_letter='N')
```

3. **Set Deployment Duration**: Defines a 10-minute subset for processing (to limit computation time).
```
    berlin_tz = pytz.timezone("Europe/Berlin")
    dt_start = datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 3, 9, 0, 0)  # 3rd June 2023, 09:00 in Berlin (CEST)
    dt1_aware = berlin_tz.localize(dt_start)  # Make it timezone-aware
    dt_end = datetime.datetime(2023, 6, 3, 10, 0, 0)  # 3rd June 2023, 10:00 in Berlin (CEST)
    dt2_aware = berlin_tz.localize(dt_end)
    deployment_start, deployment_end = dt1_aware.timestamp(), dt2_aware.timestamp()
```

4. **Parse Classifier Results**: The script reads acoustic classification results and aligns them with timestamps.
```
    if not os.path.exists(out_pkl_file):
        dict_devid_df = parse_classifications_as_dir(dir_path=dir_classification)  # key: devid, value: dataframe
        dict_devid_df = add_date_to_classification_dataframe(dict_devid_df, deployment_start)
        dict_devid_df = check_and_fill_missing_entries(dict_devid_df)  # there shouldn't be any, but make sure no gaps exist
        save_classification_data(dict_devid_df, out_pkl_file)
```

5. **Define TASE Parameters**: Thresholds and configuration for the Territorial Acoustic Species Estimation (TASE) algorithm.: The script reads acoustic classification results and aligns them with timestamps.

```
    params = Parameters(
        threshold_R=0.8,
        threshold_B=0.1,
        TS_delta=0.2,
        threshold_T=spec.max_root_2_leaf_distance(),
        d_max=100,
    )
```

6.1. **Build Graph and Extract Territories**: 

```
    graph = CustomizedGraph()  # by default, nothing happens here
    graph.add_nodes_with_coordinates(device_list=node_locations_utm)  # add nodes, including their coordinates
    graph.add_classifications_for_each_node(pkl_file=out_pkl_file)  # each node contains a list of their classification results
```

6.2. **Apply TASE for each window starting at deployment_start to deployment_end (refers to seconds)**
```
    territorial_subgraphs_all = {}  # key: epoch-timestamp, value: territorial subgraphs
    for ts in range(int(deployment_start), int(deployment_end)-7, 1):  #  5 s gap between recordings + 3 s BirdNET gap = 8s time of last classification window
        start_dt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(ts, tz=berlin_tz)
        end_dt = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(ts+3, tz=berlin_tz)  # the value 3 refers to 3 seconds, which is BirdNET's window
        print(f"Apply TASE on period from {start_dt} to {end_dt}")
        graph.init_graph(directedGraph=True)  # init the graph with the locations
        graph.set_weight_to_timestamp(ts)  # set the weights of the node to a specific window
        graph.delauny(e_delta=0.2)  # perform delauny algorithm, add edge only if condition is met
        graph.remove_long_edges(d_max=params.d_max)  # remove edges that exceed 100m
        # 6.3 Apply TASE-Algorithm to extract territorial subgraphs
        territorial_subgraphs = graph.tase(threshold_R=params.threshold_R,
                                           threshold_B=params.threshold_B,
                                           threshold_T=params.threshold_T,
                                           TS_delta=params.TS_delta)
```

6.3. **Derive representation for each territorial subgraph**

```
        for root in territorial_subgraphs:
            territorial_subgraphs[root]['location'] = calculate_weighted_centroid_from_nxgraph(territorial_subgraphs[root]['TS'])
        territorial_subgraphs_all[ts] = territorial_subgraphs
```

7. **Extract and Visualize Results**: Estimated species locations are extracted and plotted as a heatmap overlay on a geospatial map.
```
dict_ts_centroids = extract_locations(territorial_subgraphs_all)
viewer = WMSMapViewer()
viewer.add_and_convert_pointcloudUTM_2_pointcloudPIXEL(dict_ts_centroids, zone_number=32, zone_letter='N')
viewer.add_node_locations(location_data_list)
viewer.display_with_heatmap(font_size=16, kde_bw_param=0.2, vmax=0.0001, figpath="./example/example_figure.pdf")
```

## Adapting TASE for custom Deployment

The minimal working example above serves as a good reference for adapting TASE to a custom deployment. The main steps need to be adjusted based on specific requirements. 
It is recommended to experiment with different parameters when applying and visualizing the results.

1. **Create a Custom Species Class**: Define a new class that inherits from core.species.Species and set the required attributes:
```
class SomeCustomClass(core.species.Species):
    def __init__(self):
        self.lat_name = "Nomen Consuetudinarium"  # Latin Name
        self.eng_name = "Custom Name"            # English Name
```

2. **Parse Location Data**: Ensure that the location data is formatted as a list of Recording_Node objects (List[Recording_Node]).


3. **Calculate Deployment Start and End**: Convert the deployment's start and end times into epoch timestamps.


4. **Parse Classification Results**: Convert the classification results into a pandas DataFrame for processing.


5. **Set TASE Parameters**: Configure the parameters specific to your deployment to optimize performance.


6. **Apply TASE Across the Deployment Duration**: Run the TASE algorithm over the entire deployment period to estimate species territories.



## Integrate Data used in Publication for Replication
The data used in this project have been processed using the university service. Unfortunately, the original directory structure could not be preserved. Instead, the data are provided as a split .zip archive that must be recombined (refer to the provided link for instructions).

Once the unzipped directory is available, e.g., on an external drive, it can be easily accessed by creating a symbolic link. In Linux, this can be done by executing the following command within the cloned Github repository: ln -s path/to/unzipped_dir ./data
